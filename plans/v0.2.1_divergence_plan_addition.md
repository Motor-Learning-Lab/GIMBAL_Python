# Proposed Addition to v0.2.1_divergence_plan_2.md

**Purpose:** Add a "Status & Organization" section immediately after the "Editor Note" and before "Issue #1"

**Placement:** Insert as a new section between lines 13-14 (after the "---" following the Editor Note)

## Status & Organization (Updated 2025-12-14)

### Overview
This plan organizes divergence debugging around **stable Issue IDs** (I1, I2, I3) and **Test Group IDs** (TG09, TG10, TG11a, TG11b). Each Issue represents a conceptual hypothesis about pathological geometry; each Test Group is an empirical A/B comparison.

### Naming Convention
- **Issues:** I1, I2, I3, ... (never reused, stable conceptual buckets)
- **Test Groups:** TG09, TG10, TG11a, TG11b, ... (zero-padded, letters for subvariants)
- **Files:** `test_tg##_I#_slug.py`, `report_tg##_I#_slug.md`, `results_tg##_I#_slug.json`

### Current Status

#### Issue I1: Root Dynamics / Temporal Coupling
**Test Group:** TG09 (`test_tg09_I1_root_fixed.py`)  
**Status (2025-12-14):** ✅ **Tested, insufficient**  
- Anchoring implemented (`x0_root` + `eps_root` with 1m std prior)
- Result: **Still 100% divergences** in anchored baseline
- Fixed-root variant: **0% divergences**
- **Conclusion:** Root parameterization is correct but insufficient. Evidence points to I2 as root cause.

#### Issue I2: Camera Conditioning / Projection Geometry
**Test Group:** TG10 (`test_tg10_I2_direct_3d.py`)  
**Status (2025-12-14):** ⏳ **Pending**  
- Test ready but not yet run
- Hypothesis: Camera projection layer induces pathological curvature
- **Prediction:** Direct 3D likelihood will eliminate divergences, confirming camera geometry is the issue

#### Issue I3: Parameter Redundancy / Identifiability
**Test Groups:** TG11a (`test_tg11a_I3_redundancy_fixed.py`), TG11b (`test_tg11b_I3_redundancy_priors.py`)  
**Status (2025-12-14):** ⏳ **Pending**  
- Tests ready but not yet run
- May be masked by I2 (camera conditioning)

### Archive: Test Groups 1-8
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**  
**Document:** `v0.2.1_divergence_TG01-08_archive.md` (formerly `v0.2.1_divergence_test_plan.md`)  
**Summary:** Completed under pre-Issue framework. TG01-08 explored HMM effects, state counts, likelihood scaling, and hierarchical variance. Superseded by Issue-based framework (I1/I2/I3).

## Integration Instructions

1. Open `plans/v0.2.1_divergence_plan_2.md`
2. Locate the end of the "Editor Note" section (around line 13, after the closing `---`)
3. Insert the above text block
4. Verify that "Issue #1: Root Random-Walk (RW) Funnel" section follows immediately after

This addition:
- ✅ Provides current status summary at top of document
- ✅ Links to related documents
- ✅ Explains naming convention
- ✅ Preserves all existing content below
- ✅ Makes Issue/TG mapping immediately visible
